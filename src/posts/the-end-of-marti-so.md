2 years ago, I embarked on a journey to make job searching easier in the US, as a new grad. It pivoted a couple of times to a productized service agency, making $6K MRR but slowly dipping back down to $1K MRR as the team grew.

This was bad for cashflow on all ends, as I was working a day job in the US and couldn’t dedicate my time to fighting for every dollar – it just wasn’t in my personality.

We’re proud of the work we’ve done as agents, connecting US startup founders to team members in the Philippines willing to work on short-term contracts. It was a win-win situation, as founders were able to find team members at lower-than-market rates, and freelancers were able to find contracts at higher-than-market rates, while we made money through the connection.

To our founders, friends, and freelancers- thank you. It’s been an honor to work with you all. But today, it’s time to move onwards and upwards. We’ve taken a lot of our HR learnings and insights to build [Hostari](https://hostari.com).
