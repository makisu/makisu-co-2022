Makisu Software Consulting Services is an experimental product studio based in the Philippines that builds SaaS products within the verticals of: HR tech and e-commerce.

We build niche software products to support the new-age startup founder in the Philippines and occasionally entertain pitches & decks for investment into Philippine SaaS startups.

Our minimum cheque size is $20,000 USD. Our terms follow [Calm Company Fund’s Shared Earnings Agreement](https://calmfund.com/shared-earnings-agreement), which is best described as a mix of debt and equity financing.

We believe that founders don’t only have a responsibility towards investors, but also towards their employees as well. With the cost of daily commodities in the Philippines rising, tech startup salaries are still paying low in comparison to foreign companies abroad. So, we are under the impression that the only solution is to hyper-increase salaries to internationally compete with other roles (i.e. a new-grad should be paid Php 100,000/net/month).

Our Philippine office is located at: 7F Finman Building, 131 Tordesillas St, Salcedo Village, Makati City | Phone: +63 (917) 883-8668

Our US office is located at: Makisu.co LLC, 101 Augustine Drive, Martinez, CA 94553-6601 | Phone: +1 (925) 567-2842
